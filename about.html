                    <p style="color:#444; margin-top:0.5rem;">Welcome to the Pateros Technological College website. This is another innovation that aims to connect us to our clientele: the students, their parents and guardians, the Municipal Government officials of Pateros and everyone else who wish to find out what’s happening in our college. As we progress, we embrace the dawn of the era of technology. This website is part of that progress.</p>
                    <p style="color:#444;">Our need to keep in touch makes way in improving of our deliverables and the way they are conveyed in the classroom. Whereas before, classes are only physically conducted, now these could be done virtually. The internet provides the means for all us for instant connectivity.</p>
                    <p style="color:#444;">We have provided several means to communicate with all our stakeholders. The PTC Online Forum, the Facebook chatrooms, aside from the physical visit to our school are all avenues for communication. Now, these means are still enhanced with the creation of the official school website. Everything PTC will come to you handy via this means. Even visitors who wish to get to know us can have access by browsing through our website pages. I congratulate the effort exerted by the PTC website team headed by our MIS department. This is the fruit of your labor. I know this is just the beginning because there will be updates that you will continue to provide. Keep up with your enthusiasm. As R.W. Emerson once said, nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.</p>
